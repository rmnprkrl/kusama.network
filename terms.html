Please read these terms and conditions carefully before accessing and using the software. By downloading and installing software onto your hardware in order to gain access to the Kusama network, You confirm that You have read these terms and conditions and that You agree to be bound by them.</p> <p>We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of these terms from time to time. If this occurs, We will notify You in adequate form on such updates. Any of your continued use of the software and the Kusama network will be deemed an acceptance to the new terms and conditions.</p> <h4>Introduction</h4> <p>We are the Web3 Foundation and nurture and steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those which utilize modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the stability of the Web3 ecosystem. We have developed a network protocol which purports to operate as an umbrella network for independent blockchain offerings and shared data or tokens across different blockchains. Parallelizable blockchains (so called "parachains") can be connected within Our network with a so called "relay chain" which provides security to the "parachains" and relays messages between them. The Kusama network is an instantiation of such protocol which has some of the properties of the final protocol.</p> <h4>These terms and conditions govern your use of the Kusama network.</h4> <p>The underlying software of the Kusama network is an open source code (protocol) that anyone can copy, use and modify. It is licensed to You under the GPL license version 3.0.
